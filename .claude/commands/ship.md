You are running a fully autonomous multi-agent sprint. Follow the complete framework lifecycle (docs/multi-agent-framework.md).

## Input
Goal: $ARGUMENTS

## Activation

Write the ship-loop state file to activate the inner loop guard:

```
Create .claude/ship-loop.local.md with:
---
iteration: 0
max_iterations: 5
---
[The goal and context]
```

## Pipeline

Execute ALL phases in order. Do not skip phases unless explicitly noted.

### Pre-Plan: Search institutional knowledge
Spawn the `learnings-researcher` agent to search ops/solutions/ and ops/decisions/ for relevant patterns.

### Phase 0: Codebase analysis
Invoke Gemini CLI with the codebase-mapping skill (skip if codebase unchanged or small fix):
```bash
gemini -p "$(cat .claude/skills/codebase-mapping/SKILL.md) Analyze the full codebase. Write to ops/ARCHITECTURE.md, ops/MEMORY.md, ops/CONTRACTS.md." > /tmp/gemini_phase0.txt 2>&1 &
```

### Phase 1: Planning
Follow the `writing-plans` skill. Apply `shadow-path-tracing` skill for non-trivial tasks. Embed CONTRACTS.md types in task descriptions. Group tasks into waves. Write ops/TASKS.md.

### Phase 1.5: Plan validation
Spawn the `plan-checker` agent. Iterate until APPROVED (max 3 rounds).

### Phase 2: Build
- If < 5 independent tasks → subagent mode with wave orchestration
- If 5+ tasks or interdependent → agent team mode with team-lead
- Run `integration-verifier` between waves
- Apply risk scoring (halt at >20% risk or 50+ file changes)

### Phase 3: Parallel review
Launch ALL reviewers simultaneously:
- Gemini CLI (architecture, design) — background bash
- Codex CLI (logic, security, tests) — background bash
- security-sentinel agent — Claude subagent
- performance-oracle agent — Claude subagent
- code-simplicity-reviewer agent — Claude subagent

### Phase 4: Process reviews
Spawn the `findings-synthesizer` agent. Apply `iterative-refinement` skill.
- Fix P1 + P2 issues
- Check convergence (use mode from arguments, default: standard)
- Loop to Phase 3 if not converged (max 3 cycles)

### Phase 5: Test
- Spawn `test-gap-analyzer` to identify coverage gaps
- Invoke Codex with TDD skill
- Fix failures, re-run until green

### Phase 6: Wrap up
- Apply `knowledge-compounding` skill (document solutions to ops/solutions/)
- Update CHANGELOG.md, MEMORY.md, TASKS.md
- Archive review files to ops/archive/[date]/
- Apply `verification-before-completion` skill (all checks must pass)
- Write ops/STATE.md for session handoff
- Remove .claude/ship-loop.local.md

Only when ALL work is verified complete:
<promise>DONE</promise>
